# Basic dKron Setup using Docker-Compose

dKron's purpose is to make kron decentralized, eliminating SPOF and enable a highly
available cronjob runner. What I'm going to do with this repository is to teach me how to
do a basic setup on dkron and make it use so that I could apply this tool at work since we
are planning to move from regular cronjob into dKron setup.
